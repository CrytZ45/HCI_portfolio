Drawing has always been my favorite way to express my imagination and emotions. Whether it’s sketching something from nature or creating abstract designs, I find peace and satisfaction in bringing my ideas to life on paper. Drawing allows me to explore different styles and techniques while continuously improving my skills. It’s a therapeutic and rewarding hobby that lets me capture moments and express thoughts in a way words cannot.
